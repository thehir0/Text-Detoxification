10825,"Relax, Ricky's going to be just fine."
10826,You are the one who is sick.
10827,"If I take over Tanque, who will I rely on?"
10828,We were looking for a man who was violent.
10829,He isn't a good person.
10830,I'm not talking about jurisdictional issues.
10831,"That makes him my asshole, not yours."

10834,The pussycat stopped at the end of the bridge.
10835,He tried to stop the killing of the cop.
10836,Don't do that to her.

10843,What is that?
10844,I didn't vote for her because she was evil.
10845,Like the ties you have.
10846,"You hypocrites, if you want to make him twice as worthy of damnation as yourselves, then you should cover sea and land."
10847,"I'm the one they're looking for, that's all."
10848,They want to take out the sheriff.
10849,Will everybody just stop?
10850,You are very close to cutting them to pieces without our help.
10851,I want to be guided by you and give up my boring freedom.
10852,The psycho slashed his throat after hearing us coming.
10853,All I care about is where I am ranked.
10854,It's ludicrous that I shagged a couple of actresses.
10855,I have seen some black ones.
10856,He'll hit me first.
10857,He'll die if you take Davd off the machine.
10858,He's a liar.
10859,I don't pay attention to the laws.
10860,You will die on a heap of broken dreams.
10861,What did you say?
10862,I keep thinking about that old man.
10863,He's an ass hole!
10864,I don't need everyone to think I'm crazy.

10874,"""Or more slothful,"" said Nanny."
10875,They were bloodsuckers and thieves.
10876,What do you like about dicks?
10877,The list was messed up by Farley.
10878,You almost made me laugh.
10879,You're a human.
10880,You won't marry us if she is black?
10881,One of the chancers was in Dublin.
10882,That's what I've been making for the last 850 nights.
10883,We're screwed if we can't find someone to corroborate your sexuality.
10884,It was terrible to decide?
10885,This hurts.
10886,"It's terrible, I saw him and it's me."
10887,"Cartman, don't say my mom is a bitch."
10888,You don't take care of yourself.
10889,You can serve as sacrifice.
10890,I have to leave the street.
10891,We're nude and we're sexy.
10892,"No offense, but if that is a woman, it looks like she was hit with a stick."
10893,What are you still doing?
10894,How could you think of me like that?
10895,Is grandma a bad person?
10896,She had a drug addiction.
10897,Best friends ever.
10898,You saw what I was made of.
10899,"That looked like roadkill and, like, sewing needles mixed together."
10900,"I'm sorry, doll, that hurts."
10901,"The sooner you find her, the quicker you can get going."
10902,"Briony, fuck sake."
10903,Who wrote this?
10904,I support Blair in all of his crazy choices.
10905,"I'm not denying he was black, but it was like he was talking to me."
10906,You're a windbag.
10907,She gave an interview.
10908,The production manager says that he's taking 30 cents of every dollar and putting it in his own pocket.
10909,I want to be eaten by crows when I am gone.

10912,Take the camera
10913,My sister is expecting.

10915,Everyone's parents did something to them.
10916,Danny!
10917,You're just a bunch of people like my Uncle Cadence.
10918,It looks like I have something.
10919,Look at them.
10920,I had sex with a girl.
10921,What if you die?
10922,"I have done wrong things in my life, but I am not a punk-ass rapist."
10923,"When you call me ""slut"", I love it."
10924,"You can bet that he took care of that, and he did it well."
10925,I don't forge steel at ports.
10926,You talk so much that it's exhausting.
10927,What is the name of the place you're in?
10928,You're afraid I'm going to burn him?
10929,At least we die like human beings.
10930,"You'd be safer with my wife than with me, believe me."
10931,Don't do that.
10932,You've turned a nine-year marriage into a hundred-year war and I brought you both here tonight.
10933,Shut the thing down!
10934,And felt like a long time.
10935,Get away from me.
10936,"I do have good taste, but I am not a slut."
10937,It connects me to the scumbags in the city.
10938,"If it were for you, I'd be dead right now."
10939,It's the worst time of the night.
10940,You were shot with a dart.
10941,"Captain, you're cutting the heads off the parking meters."
10942,I would know if you were lying.
10943,Why should we take our own lives?
10944,You saw me with Christina last year.
10945,She was attracted to that foreigner and now she's attracted Miss G.
10946,"I mean Georgia, her husband is not having sex with you."
10947,He could have put it in the cash register.
10948,Do you think you can make a monkey out of me?
10949,Shut up and listen to our wisdom.
10950,You wonder why the cops show up when the jewelry store has turned into a wild west show.
10951,It's not true.
10952,"Chief, I could kill you right now, I bet."
10953,This guy is going to blow your house up with everyone else in it.
10954,I agree that nothing compares to the feeling of a load blowing up.
