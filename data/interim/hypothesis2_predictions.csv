2266,"next time, I'll catch you spraying'skeeter repellent on your feet."

2362,hot Lips!
2363,what you don't know will kill you.
2364,I know that look.

2884,I think someone wants to kill former members of our team.
2885,"real penthouse, Cass."
2886,your little lies...
2887,don't look at me!

2896,not to mention the amount of antlers that are going to get removed.
2897,I forgot my breasts.
2898,get out of here!
2899,bury them in the system.
2900,the degustation's got what?
2901,look at this.
2902,"now, let me ask you something: Is there a place for an old-fashioned larder like me on today's television?"
2903,well it was pretty; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun.
2904,"I pulled a chair next to the door, and I nearly took his head off with a baseball bat."

2913,my puppet.
2914,I can't have one of them attacked.
2915,"you can say he's useless, but if that's not dedication, I don't know what it is."
2916,"yeah, but then he delivers his books a week after you've delivered them, they're gonna put him in jail, and he's got a greasy twat, Guy."
2917,"that doesn't sound crazy to me. """
2918,hell.
2919,"okay, Rangers, it's time to go!"
2920,"Yueh looked thin and ineffectual, yet the gleam in his eyes was genuinely murderous."

2922,we'd be in the garage and beating people on TV.
2923,they're worse than rabbits!
2924,"after we broke up, things got weird and weird, and then I took the crazy detour with Stu, and we had some good times, but nothing felt right."
2925,"they give me a breath test, and they lock me up, right?"
2926,"you're going to take the bullets to Mr. Scaramanga, because if he doesn't get them, he won't show up at the bottom."

2939,Whats more pathetic than wanting to vote for a criminal?
2940,now you hit me.
2941,"people don't scare me, I come up here every night and tell him the news."
2942,"she's not a black woman, but she's not good enough for the house either."
2943,does it change what you wear?
2944,you're too susceptible to psychics and dreams and dirty toilet seats.
2945,you're lucky I didn't hit you.
2946,"but to Anita, they were dead men, shot directly between their eyes, and good riddance of bad things."
2947,what kind of loser thinks anyone else is interested?

2952,what are you talking about?
2953,based on probable cause and general jerk-holery.

2965,and a sexy man.
2966,"sex with God, no."
2967,it's worthwhile to point out that the American public's ignorance of the federal income tax is a testament to how dumbed-down and oblivious the American population really is.
2968,"""give me a hand."""
2969,you read what I'm saying.
2970,get out of my house!
2971,"I'm not going to sleep with you, George."
2972,burning in the fireplace.
2973,"I think she's got an amazing body, but the accent makes her over the top."
2974,"but we don't have any money, so I'll get some."
2975,you're a mother and a bad person.
2976,"Foreman, we'll draw blood."
2977,you were sick when you were my age.
2978,"Sir, I'm not going to let him die alone."
2979,"you have to treat me, 'cause I can't afford it anymore."
2980,because he doesn't want her back.

3001,I can't hear you threatening to take my life until you get on the radio.
3002,my stubborn French brain sees right through you.

3017,"whoever it was, he left it behind."
3018,don't try that reverse psychology.
3019,people think I'm crazy.

3029,"I know what it looks like, but I swear I'm gonna get out of here."
3030,"if you keep your mouth shut, you won't go to jail."
3031,"she was a tall, big-boned Irish woman with a face like a piece of leather and a large nose and legs planted like oaks."
3032,how many ways do I have to tell you that I'm fine?
3033,"take the guns, Constable!"
3034,what else do you call yourself?
3035,"did he say ""making love""?"
3036,my downstairs sex room.

3045,call me in 30 seconds or die.
3046,you're lucky you have a ear left to hear the question.
3047,"I was on the street, Ella."
3048,"those are Pufta's hillbillies, he brought them to the stand as his own private army, as if he had supporters behind him, so he could take over the club."
3049,"I'll take blood parasites, but I'll take organic brain dementia."

3051,"she'd be unhappy, and you'd know it."
3052,I hear your mother is a slave driver.
3053,five minutes is enough to put a man down here.
3054,"hell, I'm still here!"
3055,what's going on?

3057,"and she was the worst kind, smiling and kicking Jen in the teeth."
3058,I don't mind looking at you in the face.
3059,"I was fired because I screwed up, but it wasn't my fault."

3065,we could catch half of you right now!
3066,I hope he takes him to the cleaners.
3067,"if I have anything, it's because you brought it to my house and left it there."
3068,I'm presumed to be alive and black.
3069,they got lucky.
3070,so you pissed off a mafioso killer just to be loved by strangers.
3071,I feared you were dead.
3072,because Ranger Rick called my dad.
3073,what's going on here?
3074,"hey, Antonio, I'm sorry about this."
3075,"get out of here, Ricky."
3076,after she confessed to me and then tried to deny it?

3079,that's really charming.
3080,you're damn right.
3081,"all I'm saying is that we're young and we're hot, and we should embrace it while we have it."

4239,it's closed.
4240,"i think no adult is messing with him, that's the problem."

4251,it's the last thing any sensible person wants to talk about on TV.
4252,"I mean, if your friend Bunny Colvin's in the body."
4253,"hell, Marco!"
4254,the setting sun painted the water in a wide strip of gold.
4255,there was a time when a cop could be left alone for 15 minutes.
4256,"what happened here, Sarge?"
4257,"I hate you if you have to, but you're an emperor."
4258,"if you touch my baby, I'll hunt you down until the day I die."
4259,"you fired me, and I told the world that you and your wife were the real reason that all those people died on flight 197, and that the guy who worked for you, David Clarke, was just a bum."
4260,it's like a Tarantino movie.
4261,"you have witchcraft in your lips, Kate."
4262,because your mother was sick.

4264,who's next?

4269,there's something crazy going on in this town.
4270,this woman will destroy everything I've built.
4271,"""I've been here for five years."""

4274,getting hacked off with these heads linking their twitters and tumblrs to their facebook accounts
4275,I'll destroy the whole day.
4276,how the hell did it happen?
4277,"like I said, when I get home, there's another girl waiting for me, so I have to sleep with two guys in one night."
4278,"but, frankly, I'm sick of your ugly faces and your dull personalities."
4279,150 ain't gonna get my boat.
4280,I know Novak was dirty because he was ripping off dealers and giving me drugs to sell.
4281,because it's where they kept prisoners before they cut their heads off.
4282,you must be rich.
4283,I trust you had a pleasant trip.
4284,let's have Leonard's birthday party.
4285,"some of those characters... not like these boys, but real scum, they were pissed."

4289,then why did you choose to write about all the things you think about me?
4290,I want you to stop acting like you don't care about anything.
4291,"by the way, the fact that he had something to do with drugs was just that."
4292,"no disrespect, Jessica, but your word means something."
4293,"beautiful loser never take it all 'cause it's easier and faster when you fall, you just don't need it all, you just don't need it all"
4294,he sighed because he knew she would accuse him of deliberately making her look bad before the real estate agent.
4295,the Maori who think they're better than the rest of us?
4296,he probably works for them... and they're lousy with midgets.
4297,I've been hiding behind your friends.
4298,I'll tell you all the things I know you've done.
4299,"""stop!"" Caramon clapped his hand over the ken-der's mouth."
4300,"we would fight, they would fight, and we would all die."
4301,get out of the car!
4302,she'll be so upset she'll never talk to you again.
4303,the only reason I came back was to find out who did it.
4304,do you want to sleep with me?
4305,I'm too fat.
4306,"cup of tea, monkey?"
4307,death by blunt trauma to the head.
4308,"give me half, Mr. Man."

4318,"go, go, go!"
4319,you sold out.
4320,"sometimes I'm proud, but I can't do anything about it."
4321,"if the NRA doesn't pay your mortgage this month, I'll give you the gun."
4322,because LeMarc stole it in 1980 when 23 others failed.
4323,"he dropped you off at the hotel and didn't come up with ""it's good to see you"" sex?"
4324,"you're happy now, man?"
4325,because I had the guts to stand up to these guys.
4326,what's going on?
4327,now you have one less person asking you questions.
4328,"""I dream of making love to you."
4329,it's my turn to dance.

4342,"you think I wanted to spend $ 1 0,000 on you, huh?"
4343,"you must be very proud of yourself, for a man who just got made into a cow in front of his daughter."
4344,so what we need from you is a worm.
4345,"if you want forgiveness or compassion or understanding, go to the priest!"
4346,get away from me!
4347,"in your interrogation, he asked you what you thought about his punishment."
4348,"""get me out of here."""
4349,I don't want to sit at the table.
4350,I'm his lawyer.
4351,"well, Agnes got her titties, so that's a bad thing!"
4352,I'm not gonna lie to you.
4353,"""Wake up, you punk!"" Said a harsh voice."
4354,"you're the one who turned this into a game, which was a waste because you're a good lawyer."
4355,I should have called it barney's law.
4356,he's Andre's.

4366,"quiet, Mike."
4367,I had a tough day.
4368,"Thats what the world is coming to, online talkers."
4369,I'll be pissed if you don't have enough time.
4370,"what are you gonna do about it, huh?"
4371,"although there are many factors at work here, the chief cause of this latest escalation will be the Mad Hungarian."
4372,"I didn't say I didn't do it, I said I didn't have time, because I was so busy saving you."
4373,stop acting like you're fine and start dealing with it.
4374,it killed me to hurt you like that.
4375,that's why you're so embarrassed.
4376,miles nobrainer is an unequaled person
4377,we're not waiting!

4382,"I just got up, running around like I was in the woods again, like I was John Wayne emptying a magazine, screaming, ""Come on, Charlie."
4383,"all you have to do is find him, put him in a bag, hit him with a rubber hose, and bring him home."
4384,I didn't just put my head in the guillotine... I untied my collar and tie so they could cut it off.
4385,do not be so childish!
4386,he's a little slippery!
4387,you're putting our lives in the hands of a crazy old man?
4388,are you nervous about killing a girl?
4389,"this is your color, man."
4390,here's your raiment for the banquet.
4391,"what did you do, try to kill them?"

4414,"the cops will go 50 bucks to beat her up, and then they'll gang up on her."
4415,"you know, not for nothing, but if you hadn't hit Ledoux back then, we might have got the whole story out of him."
4416,"I'm a businessman trying to stay afloat, just like you."
4417,and would it kill you to put on your clothes?
4418,get out of here.
4419,"you're too skinny to be a nanny, Barrett."
4420,"since you don't like sunlight, we've modified the gun's entry light with a UV filter."

4465,"yeah, but if a bunch of psychos burst in here and threaten to blow this place up, unless we recite pi to ten digits, then..."
4466,do you know why I came all the way to this stinking pile of a city?

5298,"one with a crust as black as sin and a centre as white as a nun's soul. """
5299,"well, Mr. Belvedere, it's going to be a one-off wedding."
5300,let everyone think I'm crazy?
5301,"your tongue likes it, do you know that?"
5302,the company is like the end of a bad storm.
5303,very selfish.
5304,they will destroy you.
5305,don't try to fool me.
5306,"""hell, I know her!"""
5307,"straight ahead 20 feet, and you're dead."
5308,"you don't have a clue, do you?"
5309,"Yuan knows, I sent the two of you to shoot him."
5310,what should we do with the traitor?
5311,"why don't you call my dad, and you two can talk all night about what I'm like?"
5312,"come on, men!"
5313,the cursed one.
5314,"""I don't know which is worse,"" Sue said, ""the nonstop talking or the new nasty brat who curses and questions everything we say."""
5315,they have a funny way of getting custody.
5316,"""Aren't you afraid I'll throw you to the pike?"" Said the head."
5317,"because underneath this beautiful body, you're a genius."
5318,"with my name, Dick."
5319,we were just saying goodbye.
5320,"you don't know what you're talking about, okay?"
5321,"you're marked with a blow that could have killed you, that's your salvation."
5322,what kind of games are you playing with me?
5323,they just sent Ronon to give her a shot.
5324,"I knew from the first time I saw you, how bad you were."
5325,get him out of here.
5326,"""miss me?"" In the house with Megan, are you crazy?"
5327,I'll never be in a woman again.
5328,"hell, I'll even introduce you to her sister."
5329,I can't go on without you!
5330,later.
5331,you scared the hell out of me.
5332,I need to drink.
5333,why do you tolerate the clown?
5334,"I'm so hungry, Bill."
5335,the guy's a Hostile.
5336,one who kills most people gets the greatest reward.
5337,but he was a little stubborn for a two-cylinder.
5338,"oh, my God."
5339,are you saying this is a list of everyone you slept with?
5340,"""if you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."""
5341,call the other monkeys.
5342,"if you want to live, it won't be here, and it won't be by your laws."
5343,don't you even think about kissing me?
5344,you're not the Pink Panther.
5345,what makes you think a poor mortal could stop me?
5346,"the old troll's life was very simple; people paid you money, and you hit other people."
5347,"and you better pray to God I'll deal with you myself, because if you ever wind up in front of Lady Harrington, you'll find yourself in trouble so quickly that you won't be able to catch up with you until you're in the stockade."
5348,"we walk away from this, Doc, and the girl dies."
5349,"if they come, they'll burn, we'll build."
5350,"you're a tease, and you know it."
5351,"if you borrow money from them, they'll charge you something that they like to call interest."
5352,get the arm out of my face!
5353,"if you're a Parrothead, try Jimmy Buffet's Key West Saloon in the lobby."
5354,Big and I were... somewhere between wild sex and a baby.
5355,get away from me!
5356,you scared the hell out of me.
5357,"""what are you doing in Nine Hells?"" The bounty hunter asked."
5358,I'm trying to get rid of the old ladies.
5359,but he was tricked...... captured...... brought to hell...... corrupted.
5360,he said he'd take Tommy out with one punch.
5361,I want my girl.
5362,"she looked at Rhun: The Fool was crying, the tears running through his distorted features."
5363,I haven't slept in three days.
5364,"in which case, I'm sure I can rely on you."
5365,"what does it look like I'm doing, Pal?"
5366,"""hell."
5367,you're making a fool of Mr. Spence.
5368,"release me, otherwise my friend will come after you!"
5369,your new prom queens are... Kara and Sara Fratelli.
5370,his six months in hell are over.
5371,"""Anita, these creatures are using you."
5372,"it's one of them, the more you scratch it, the more you scratch it."
5373,can't a man get a little peace in his own house?
5374,they killed them in New York!
5375,"I understand, he wants to sleep with her, and she's obviously had sex and..."
5376,I told you my brother was crazy.
5377,I think I can get my hands on a couple of bullets.
5378,"you put yourself in the bin, and you shoot into the stratosphere?"
5379,"rich, famous, handsome, like cement."
5380,I don't owe you anything.
5381,I've been driving all over the mountain trying to find you.
5382,"it's terrible, but I'm the good guy."
5383,"so when you ask people about illegal things, they have a certain patina."
5384,but it also seemed to me that it wasn't just one room of our friendship that was closed off; it was a whole wing.
5385,we might have to kick him out.
5386,your Yanks!
5387,I thought you'd be in Wilder Hall with Susie Sorority.
5388,no... plumber.
5389,have you lost your mind?
5390,who is Alicia?
5391,"what is ""us""?"
5392,it's a serious crime.
5393,he'll be dead by morning.
5394,"no, these guys find me, they assume I know about the recording, they'd probably kill me, right?"
5395,chicken?
5396,I don't have time for this mess.
5397,I'll give you an anal chip.
5398,"so if you love him, why do you sleep with me?"
5399,smart.
5400,or he's an alcoholic or a drug addict or he's bipolar.
5401,now you can either come with us willingly or I'll knock you out and take you there.
5402,how did he put together a band so quickly?
5403,"when she took it off, the flowers fell from her chest."
5404,"I mean, the power to cause accidents."
5405,"how am I supposed to relay what these two guys said to me, if I don't say it?"
5406,"I fired as I came up, blowing holes in her body like a zipper until I came to that pale face."
5407,"you know, I'd hand out the towels and shave the Greek kids' backs."
5408,"so, killing Harrison doesn't free up a penny for Devon or Buckley."
5409,crazy!
5410,I think we should sleep together.
5411,no more urban combat.
5412,get out of the street!
5413,it's dead animals mixed together!
5414,"you let him do it to me, and you'll be more evil than Mara ever was."
5415,"all right, I admit that my natural impulse is to doubt people's claims to happiness, but yours is to be a sucker for them."
5416,it smells like smoke from heaven.
5417,"that you're racist, Sir."
5418,let's get rich!
5419,"""maybe you'll do it if they're going to round you up."
5420,I bet this is nonsense.
5421,it occurred to me that Jo was never going to turn the page and hear Strickland call the poor Stroeve a funny little man.
5422,because you're messing with the wrong girl.
5423,report the girls who ran away from me?
5424,'he can keep the spoon! 'Said Vimes.
5425,"hell, that's a lot of money."
5426,"all right, let me get out of here."
5427,go!
5428,one word and I'll hit you again.
5429,"and they would haunt you... and me, as the guy who had to listen to you."
5430,it's not my fault my heart had a different plan.
5431,"I understand you're here, you're gay."
5432,hey get a job man its hot as hell where thad n i are
5433,you have to put an end to this. You'll thank me later.
5434,buying a raffle ticket lol
5435,"don't worry, Slink, we'll get you."
5436,"leeches, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires"
5437,burn the sinful things before they burn you.
5438,"listen, you yokel."
5439,their duty was to protect him until he met and killed Deathwalker.
5440,but we're not...
5441,a sick priest?
5442,you'll piss on my door if you don't go by morning.
5443,you look like one of them.
5444,death is an easy way out.
5445,"""then you're dead too,"" Borel said."
5446,"listen to me, you neophyte."
5447,she can whip 100 guys all by herself.
5448,and I'd say trusting an alcoholic ex-government hitman is a greater challenge than trusting a middle-aged cripple.
5449,he's the master of space and time.
5450,and I'll be damned if I let someone else tell you about it!
5451,then he thought of something he wanted to ask their shaggy friend.
5452,random mugging.
5453,and now you're just covering up because you're worried about a malpractice suit.
5454,his dentures were there.
5455,what are you talking about?
5456,we slept in the bathroom next to the courtroom six.
5457,psycho.
5458,one minute you're happy-go-lucky Hurley and the next you're Colonel Kurtz.
5459,let's get out of here.
5460,"every time she walks away from you, she's miserable."
5461,"mom, this is important, and you have to hear it."
5462,I could have her any time I wanted.
5463,"for Eurocentric indoctrination, it's learning in an environment that's mostly white."
5464,"""they only kill women."""
5465,you're an animal!
5466,does it help your sex life?
5467,"read, hell."
5468,"Bill, you just licked my blood."
5469,we'll have to shoot them by hundreds.
5470,"okay, maybe there's some... some fans who don't like it."
5471,I mistakenly trusted the demons and killed righteous officials.
5472,who gave the order?
5473,do you think I'm crazy?
5474,do you want to make fun of me?
5475,"no, boobs, techno and trumpets are much cooler."
5476,"Maxwell, we're screwed."
5477,I'll put a tube in your chest to get rid of your lung.
5478,"it's a shame, Chili."
5479,now you cut him down!
5480,nonsense!
5481,I'm sick of laughing at Grandma and Grandpa when they're separated.
5482,"you sell the Israelis the radar, so that's why he says, ""To hell with it."""
5483,she used to work at the car dealership.
5484,"don't mess with me, sweetheart."
5485,make him suffer.
5486,I'll shoot anyone who's bothering me!
5487,"grandma, you know we're terrible."
5488,grandpa taught me to shoot.
5489,we're not hungry anymore. Miami is changing.
5490,timing is always the key to success.
5491,"happiness, sex, pastrami."
5492,you can't kill me.
5493,we're waiting in this cafe for two days.
5494,"please nurse for a woman with a dead head, you're not very open minded."
5495,you're okay with your girlfriend screwing 15 guys a day and getting paid for it?
5496,"""even now, the odds are very good that we'll be able to hit the hole in the middle of your fleet."
5497,"poor guy. """
5498,"i don 't know, reshashing the same joke over and over again is pretty retarded still."
5499,"if he built up his chest and arms, I'd be crazy."
5500,"sometimes you don't answer the phone, so he's hiding under the door."
5501,show her the money.
5502,leave this at home.
5503,"I'm not gonna lie to you, right?"
5504,"all I have to do is wear a wig and change my voice a little bit, and the kids can't tell the difference."
5505,I blew everything up.
5506,"well, it's a nice sentiment, but how do I know you're not crazy?"
5507,I never heard of Ava Hessington until she came through my door.
5508,get over here and don't be so selfish!
5509,I told you I couldn't see anything out of this helmet.
5510,they were so flat-headed that their ears were sticking out of their skulls.
5511,"what did I tell you about staying on the wall, ghosts?"
5512,"you come here, you ask me if someone named Heroin has checked into the hotel, 'cause you want to buy drugs and that's how you do it?"
5513,she never won that thing for a second.
5514,get back to Russia!
5515,you should put more whites in.
5516,the radio is terrible.
5517,"if I was speeding, give me the ticket."
5518,"unless you're in uniform, no one sees you as a man."
5519,I'm a pig.
5520,"hell, guys..."
5521,such a hurry.
5522,I'm scared.
5523,"'stop, thief! '"
5524,your soap.
5525,"he came running at me, a high-born boy, thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword."
5526,"maybe, but not crazy!"
5527,your liver.
5528,The us is going to be led by an ignoramus no amount of wishful thinking will change that.
5529,you made shirts.
5530,"I don't want someone poking around in me, hoping I die."
5531,"I find it disgusting, Major Hecht, but I'm sure you don't want to see your so-called soldiers expire of terminal priapism."
5532,"""it's terrible,"" Larry said, and moved to his feet."
5533,"we're not so naive to think they won't kill us, but all the Jews?"
5534,you have to run for your life.
5535,he hates cops.
5536,open your mouth for me.
5537,"he called it ""Drone 1."""
5538,"this is a useless genie, poetry is all it's good at."
5539,he wants the brain of the child.
5540,"planting a body on our property, killing Pete, and not one new Mutt, but two."
5541,"if not, throw him out of the Wall."
5542,"but if they don't wake up, they'll starve to death."
5543,his name is everywhere in Dublin.
5544,are you kidding me?
5545,"""or about justice, or the appeals process in Georgia, or about any of those things."
5546,"but trust me, she burns them."
5547,you decide whether to disband or kill.
5548,get out of my face!
5549,"I can't smoke, I can't leave the room."
5550,you're Jewish and you know it.
5551,"she would be dead right now, instead of at home with her family."
5552,I knew it was only a matter of time.
5553,it's good weed.
5554,"but we're behind schedule, and the producers are beating us up."
5555,we can make your career as a killer a matter of record.
5556,"it's all very well saying you have to change one little detail, but which one?"
5557,"then he rubbed his cheek again, and you said, ""It doesn't scratch anymore."""
5558,"but even the best girls will sleep with you, you know?"
5559,"but I can't work with someone who worships such a petty, vindictive, unimaginative God such as yours."
5560,"last week, one of them sent me a bag of his stuff."
5561,how did you do it?
5562,get away from me!
5563,"you're just infected with a virus, a sexually transmitted disease."
5564,"""if it doesn't bleed your ears, it doesn't do its job."""
5565,you two got out of here.
5566,I'm sure you want to beat them up.
5567,"honey, why do you want to sleep there?"
5568,"Ray, did you hear what I said?"
5569,he's Dakota Fanning.
5570,I don't think Beck can hear me.
5571,"you're blind, she loves you!"
5572,fool?
5573,you're talking about John G. being a drug dealer...
5574,"are you brave, all of a sudden?"
5575,stop talking about your phone.
5576,"I saw you kill those guys who kidnapped us when you first came back, didn't I?"
5577,"my new job really stinks, and I mean to tell you this is meant as literal as possible."
5578,"because I'm tired of hearing how bad he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him."
5579,"if we were there, we'd get out of this coach."
5580,name's farhad ghazi... he's a real creep.
5581,"if you kill her, she'll step in. Otherwise, you're on your own."
5582,you're a disgrace.
5583,"when she worked her way down to the careful cleaning of the genital area, necessary for relaxation, Ferrell fled."
5584,"hey, Rose, do us a favor."
5585,get your hands where I can see them!
5586,"if we remain silent, the Pangarans will use Egeria as a source for their drug until she dies."
5587,and the Barrayaran thieves will stick together.
5588,"you get him to take a beating, everything will be okay."
5589,we have to charge you with murder.
5590,or just a negro?
5591,how the hell are you?
5592,"and you, too, Jim."
5593,Why do they always announce dinner like a cavalry charge?
5594,the psycho is not my boyfriend.
5595,you just get me to my destination... and I'll let you and the crew go.
5596,my advice to losers like you has made me famous on Twitter.
5597,don't mess with our plans!
5598,I just figured she was an alcoholic.
5599,I'm old. It's depressing.
5600,"baby, don't even try to refute me, just give me your number."
5601,the scum who went up to the surface revived the solar energy for us.
5602,I don't need to kill people anymore.
5603,it was the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
5604,"sure, the man was a scamp, probably a deserter, certainly a belittler, but-- well, there it was."
5605,'damn right! 'Said the man.
5606,I'll just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.
5607,"M.O.D.O.K., will I destroy them for wasting our time?"
5608,he hasn't slept with anyone in the bathroom.
5609,why don't you guys get out of here and settle for each other tonight?
5610,"it was true, the Fool thought."
5611,I never wanted to see anything like that!
5612,"you have the expensive chase in the beginning, the expensive equipment, the office..."
5613,Ernst Janning... who made his life... because he walked with them.
5614,"the rest of you, anemic."
5615,"she looked around wildly and for a moment her frightened, confused mind fully expected to see the child-beater Elmer Haney standing in the shadowy space of the big upstairs room that had been Ralph's study."
5616,"I swear to God, if you don't stop, I'll shoot."
5617,we're just a bunch of mercenaries who want to make a big hit.
5618,"and as silly as it may sound, I'm not going to settle for anything less."
5619,"I mean, watching the Italian opera, all the male sopranos screaming, the fat couples rolling their eyes."
5620,funny how Nazis are always the bad guys.
5621,you must have scrubbed the couch like a madman.
5622,how big are these rats?
5623,I told him.
5624,"well, that was a hell of a lot."
5625,you're really noisy.
5626,I wish I had a bully.
5627,you have to soak your hands in vinegar and rub them in sand.
5628,she named her Fanny.
5629,and you know what it is?
5630,"when the tree is sick and weak, hang it on the tree."
5631,I don't like him.
5632,what do you want?
5633,they're terrible.
5634,"well, the slide is off limits, but you can go crazy on the swings."
5635,you've already ruined me once.
5636,"I don't smoke, I don't play football, and I have an I.Q. over 25."
5637,"you can run and resist, forcing me to kill you now."
5638,"here, wipe your face."
5639,fire!
5640,"17 years ago, the old church said a tall man with scars came through."
5641,maybe just get out of here.
5642,"you let him do it to me, and you'll be more evil than Mara ever was."
5643,you're the one who killed the little ones!
5644,that's what you're like.
5645,who's hunting us?
5646,"be still, my foolish heart."
5647,I was wrong.
5648,maybe... but now I'm your father's right-hand man.
5649,Greatboo was an alien invader like the Six.
5650,what planet has an elliptical orbit?
5651,I spoke to him.
5652,doesn't anyone care that I have a finely crafted gun pointed at this boy's head?
5653,they cut the tires.
5654,that sounds like a lot of kicking.
5655,I can't tell my family about you.
5656,get out of here.
5657,this is the one I told you about.
5658,"i don't understand a thing, but i got the poster."

5664,I don't even know how to get on the bus.
5665,"come back here, I'll turn off the switches, and we'll blow it up in space."
5666,stop the fire!
5667,"hey, baby, get out of my life."
5668,"I'm sorry, but I can't get inside."
5669,"if you marry her, I won't shoot you."
5670,"and I will not leave this planet in the hands of a nihilist like Huark, to continue his butchery until someone finally makes the decision I should have made! """
5671,touch me and there will be blood.
5672,you took a bullet for Parker.

5676,"I thought he'd get an extension, but the school didn't like it."
5677,I just got out of here this morning.
5678,and get your feet off my table!

6117,I smell the blood of porn.
6118,"go to hell, you're making me mad."
6119,she should be put out of her misery.
6120,it's out of their minds.
6121,"you know, I'm sick of your materialism!"
6122,can someone clean it up?
6123,"I was there, but I didn't kill you."
6124,where's my money?
6125,"I loved you then, and I love you now."
6126,"the rain, dancing to the rhythm of the thunder, full-on Tantric orgasm, are you kidding me?"
6127,"yes, the time will come when blacks and whites will walk on the same campus."
6128,they'd have to kill us or something.
6129,I want a crack at the stalker.
6130,You know being a dick and being Indian are two different things right?
6131,I'm a complete failure as a princess.
6132,all the Wookiees are dead.
6133,"at that point, a second officer will kill the assassin from behind with a silenced gun - and then escape."
6134,"on the other hand, I thought it was pond scum."
6135,"but out of the shadows, through the doors of hidden mouths in the mud walls, there came his servants, hooded, robed, as before."
6136,she was born in a crazy-traditional way.
6137,the kind of guy who spends 10 grand on Gandalf the Grey's quarterstaff from The Two Towers.
6138,"curse your sudden, but inevitable betrayal."
6139,"it forces him to steal, and if necessary, to kill."
6140,"otherwise, his wound will eventually kill him."
6141,"but it loves me, and I love it!"
6142,that's the greatest thing anyone ever did for me.
6143,I love drunk people
6144,we who are about to die salute you.
6145,I haven't seen much else except for the Germans trying to kill us.
6146,"in order to learn the secret, I have to cure his madness."
6147,I'm not gonna give him a chance to grab another ship... or cut another pilot's throat.
6148,I hope you're kidding me.
6149,"the great thing about work is no matter how bad your personal life is, your professional life can make it seem normal."
6150,"when you go to one of those doctors, do you pull yourself together, or do you pull yourself together?"
6151,"Princess Karina of Argon, you pirate..."
6152,I don't care either way.
6153,nobody cares about it.
6154,I'm calling you to thank you for begging me to go to Shane.
6155,you cut in and take what you want.
6156,get me out of here!
6157,it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine.
6158,you sent me to North Carolina so you could sleep with my girlfriend.
6159,and his strange and ugly raffishness and omelost.
6160,they're rats with wings.
6161,Duiker glanced back at the Foolish Dog Horsemen.
6162,I had to sleep with this girl in front of about 100 people.
6163,she's kryptonite.
6164,"Hardy, what are you doing?"
6165,I didn't go all the way to my daughter's wedding.
6166,"you love it, don't you?"
6167,"Emma, before you came along, a lot of people were selfish."
6168,it's not my fault!
6169,"please stop saying ""faggot."""
6170,"that's what you want, to get me into this zone."
6171,"then your parents can hire a lawyer to clean up the mess, and you can go to another country."
6172,your laws don't mean anything to them!
6173,"run, kick!"
6174,"""you're crazy,"" he said."
6175,we don't allow Jews.
6176,I hate them.
6177,"tell me why I'm blacked out, why I'm bleeding, and why your grandma kicked my face down the stairs."
6178,I just got out of jail.
6179,now get out of my house.
6180,so be quiet and start shopping.
6181,hands behind your head and on the ground.
6182,so you didn't know the other one was gay?
6183,"luck, my God!"
6184,"the dick stays in the pants, right?"
6185,"what are you doing, Lee?"
6186,all children are ugly at eight.
6187,are you upset that I didn't cover you?
6188,"they're out there in the dark, stalking us."
6189,it smells like several people died here.
6190,"in honour of Diva Week, let's just cut it and keep it real."
6191,"but Jews, why do you hate the Jews?"
6192,"I may hit you in the face, but why don't you go home?"
6193,"I don't care what you keep in your own house, but when you bring freaks and abominations into our churches in front of our children, you have to..."
6194,it made my existence in the previous week seem like a rat living on crumbs and ferreting in the garbage.
6195,now get back in the kitchen and bring me something I won't choke on.
6196,stand with me.
6197,"the hypocrisy of the English, Max!"
6198,no drama behind this nonsense.
6199,even sex is a mystical experience for you.
6200,what do you think they'll do to you?
6201,"and if you think I'm going to listen to a lot of nonsense about it, then you're mistaken."
6202,you worked hard to get this teacher to take you.
6203,and I'll kill you!
6204,"the day after the St. Mary's outbreak, Percy gave up his gun, Keyes died in a fire."
6205,"the instrument of evil, the most innocent instrument!"
6206,just be quiet and come to Seoul with me.
6207,"I have a lot of things going on, Jose."
6208,"he's a big drama queen, everything's so heavy and negative, he's such a victim."
6209,so the stewardess goes up from the back of the plane to tell him the microphone's still on.
6210,"Jesus, are you crazy?"
6211,chances are I'll kill the lion in the thicket.
6212,then wake him up.
6213,at least I have Mrs. Moron.
6214,get on the floor.
6215,I'm saying you're just a bad memory for me.
6216,and it went bad.
6217,he said he'd come back in 20 years.
6218,they found Chairman Ma's body and brought it to the station.
6219,"if you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to me."
6220,"he just kicked me out on the street, but..."
6221,I don't know anything... what do you mean?
6222,is that Peter Frampton?
6223,there's something wrong with the candle.
6224,"well, I'll give you ten percent."
6225,"I went back to take a leak, and then it went off."
6226,you lost your head.
6227,speak to your little boy.
6228,"I don't know why he killed her, but he's a bad guy. """
6229,"if you mean awesome and sexually stimulating, then I agree."
6230,just be friends with her.
6231,I want him out of here.
6232,"you have problems with the whole world, and I'm in it."
6233,"yes, but Wayne was just playing, you know?"
6234,"""I didn't try - I did it!"""
6235,what are these things?
6236,if you have sex again after taking ellaOne
6237,you have a nerve.
6238,you don't know what it is to drink your blood.
6239,that should make his brother squirm a little.
6240,you never feel more alive than when you kill another human being.
6241,a criminal out of City.
6242,"the woman he knew well, who operated in the eastern dock area."
6243,now I bet the Chinese will wipe you out without your guns.
6244,I can ride faster and you shoot better than any of them.
6245,"because in two hours, this place will be crawling with 10 Zando-Zans with just one thought in their minds, killing Alex Rogan."
6246,what if he thinks I saw him?
6247,he was gay all the time they were married.
6248,"I never want to hear the self-deprecating voice of yours, or see your smug, lily-white face."
6249,"in the proletarian areas, they attack a baby and, within five minutes, they cut it to the bone."
6250,they destroy the Earth.
6251,now we need some old people.
6252,"""oh, look at the blonde and her hot friend trying to do something."""
6253,imagine Jack the Ripper or Muammar Khadafi as a woman.
6254,what is a civet?
6255,"""you still think I'm crazy,"" the Baron said, ""and this, but it's confirmed."
6256,"and right now, I need you to break one, and tell me the number of Kleinman's room."
6257,"you have every right to be unhappy, but you're not, because even though this job is crazy and the house is crazy, you like it."
6258,so you're gonna bust my nose to keep people away from me?
6259,Zack is crazy about the guitar.
6260,I was running out of my own stuff.
6261,"if you're lying to me, I'll take you away from you."
6262,I want to inhale her.
6263,"I really like your mama, Rabbit."
6264,These days that just means you get assumed to be a drug kingpin and targeted for civil forfeiture.
6265,"my team will be there, I'll make half a billion dollars."
6266,you want to drive the whole town to suicide?
6267,"you have to be quiet and concentrate, Maurice."
6268,"take it, I'm doing it for you."
6269,"he's talking about running with your money, or whatever he's talking about."
6270,"but I swear to God, if you want to lead a magic-free life, I'm all for it."
6271,the least you can do is walk right in there and hit the hole for the woman who drags your garbage can up your driveway every Tuesday!
6272,"if I have to kill you, I'll do it."
6273,we have to run those illegals across the border.
6274,                              
6275,I'll just tell Janine that you want me to wait in the car so you can try and sleep with her.
6276,what a family.
6277,we're not crazy.
6278,get out of here!
6279,"if it was a pin or a watch or something, but I'm not wearing a wire from 1976."
6280,"this is our ranch, and you're the animals waiting for slaughter."
6281,keep your mouth shut until you die.
6282,"okay, I figured out what we have to do with the landing module."

6286,these guys don't care about him because they're FBL!
6287,"always had bad timing, Jules."
6288,you'd say less and you'd say less.
6289,"I won't, Franciscan savage."
6290,"""you're insubordinate."
6291,instead I put my faith in naked women and hands.
6292,tell your brother to let me go.
6293,"but the man you killed did, which is why Papa Legba hired you to kill him."
6294,"""leave and watch it somewhere else."""
6295,"son, the last thing you have to do is point a gun at the man you think killed Gracie."
6296,he complained that he was tired.
6297,"but for some reason, I want to shoot."
6298,we're surrounded by trash.
6299,I hope the old man doesn't fool himself.
6300,and what were you doing here in the middle of the night?
6301,"the courier, considering this, shook his head in disgust."
6302,I can't leave without an explanation.
6303,"""your friend shot us."""
6304,only one.
6305,this time the only way is hard!
6306,she ran away with her sister.
6307,that should shut you up
6308,a small price to pay for your mother's killer.
6309,even she hides from me and she's my mom.
6310,"well, this guy's driving me crazy, okay?"
6311,it must be terrible to have your face so badly burned that you can't see it.
6312,I don't like being naked in front of a male doctor.
6313,"then you know I'll survive, and Naevia will return to me."
6314,"you're jealous, huh?"
6315,get the dogs out of here!
6316,"if I do this, I want you to promise me that you're going to cut it out."
6317,for God's sake.
6318,"these people are draconian, and in an evil and twisted derby between the Communists and the Fundamentalists, it's 6-to-5 to pick them up, as far as I'm concerned."
6319,"I listened to the answers for a while, nodded and commiserating, then asked other similar complaints about officers, latrines, kitchen police - and all the others so dear to the enlisted man's heart."
6320,"it's not that they're wrong about you, it's that they're giving you something."
6321,you get him to do your dirty work and take the money and dump me!
6322,it was his turn to hang his head.
6323,"if I step into that forest, I'm dead."
6324,"well, now that is simpl asinine, - yes, but you see, Garth, this is not what you just called ""some other line of work."""

12440,we were virgins.
12441,do you earn your money by your own effort?
12442,it's the witch's fault!
12443,that's my best friend Barry messing with her on an IKEA table I bought for a very good price.
12444,"yeah, you try to sign up for that."
12445,or... is she the cutest little blonde you've ever seen?
12446,I'm going home!
12447,"it probably came from the guy who smashed his nose, though he didn't know how he did it."
12448,only when you worry about a soldier is when he stops.
12449,"Irish mob, Piracy."
12450,it wouldn't take long before they started talking about you.
12451,"mom didn't tell her ""I almost slept with Jerry Van Dyke."""
12452,do you want to sleep with him?
12453,Gordon ramsay says you're terrible.
12454,and I'll nail you.
12455,and now he's sleeping with the Chili Peppers.
12456,of course it's not fair!
12457,he looked like he wanted to die.
12458,"I'm sorry, but you don't say that."
12459,get out of the hole!
12460,but I don't have a chance if I'm lusting over her blood.
12461,"don't be crazy, Oz."
12462,"once you know the truth, you'll never be crazy."
12463,"oh, God, why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?"
12464,I don't even care about the movie anymore.
12465,"I would have joined in with a great harmony, but the guy was naked."
12466,he's hiding something and you know it.
12467,bloody and sickening.
12468,"you bet, Bubba."
12469,is that no one will care when I send you to jail for assaulting a federal agent?
12470,"she could be useful in the future, and moving her now would be as good as killing her."
12471,"come on, babe, get out of here."
12472,that covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless man.
12473,regulation says I have to turn this into waste.
12474,you want to tell me what happened before I sent you back to jail?
12475,"of all the ""Howard humpers"" stories, this is my favourite."
12476,didn't you just order a sex worker?
12477,"get in here, man!"

12481,"oh partner, laughing so hard i got tears in my eyes."
12482,it's a vulva!
12483,"but they all knew and all were equally furious that he had failed, except for Zataki."
12484,an MP from Camp Pendleton suspected the Marines were working with some bad cops.
12485,"I'm just guessing they'll find a client list, surgeons, dentists... everyone else involved in your poor operation."
12486,"four men grabbed Hansen from behind and tried to pull him away, but he pulled the trigger."
12487,"get rid of her, Cyril."
12488,that was Little Johnny Demm who screwed up the money.
12489,thank you.
12490,"oh, my God."
12491,that's a mess!
12492,"rape of an underage girl, coldblooded brutality..."
12493,he looks like someone who shot someone?
12494,"just as anyone could have watched Mary and Sasha, two cute teenage girls were horny."
12495,are you gonna take this?
12496,"no offense, Officer, but I'm pretty upset about this."
12497,he made them all flinch.
12498,I can't believe the gods would want such a woman to die.
12499,"I can't blame her, though. Young men are always at the door."
12500,"you won't believe it, Beth."
12501,I'm dancing!
12502,"Alex, what are you doing?"
12503,"he had taken the chance to kill the Jew Greengold - he was tongue-lashed by the Emir himself, and he was told never to do anything like that again."
12504,it just feels so damn...
12505,"well, the agency caught him looking at porn on the computer."
12506,"if there's 20 naked guys in there, I'm usually in the top 8."
12507,it's not worth it.
12508,get out of the car!
12509,so gross!
12510,"I know you have a demon in a meatsuit, and trust me, you'll pay for it."
12511,"but don't tell his wife, because she's crazy."
12512,"and you're a flatterer, Colonel."
12513,"to your raison d'etre, which if you keep ignoring, you'll be useless to your sisters."
12514,stop messing around and let the girl go.
12515,"here you go, slugger."
12516,the pigs' teeth.
12517,"rule number two, never go home with a girl whose roommate you slept with the same morning."
12518,I want him gone.
12519,he won't get enough potatoes in the can to kill him.
12520,tasty.
12521,did you really think I'd stay on the farm after I decrypted Percy's black box?
12522,"maybe if we were looking for a woman of the night for you to kill, you'd suddenly perk up and become incredibly helpful!"
12523,you can't even take a picture of your grandmother without taking her head off.
12524,because people have to know whether or not their president is a crook.
12525,maybe our killer cut her and then got out of here before he got blood on himself.
12526,"well, if this is such a mess, why don't you stop it?"
12527,you're the one who got us here - and that's only because everyone you've ever met knows you're so bad!
12528,"no, I mean, it's the least I can do after you saved me this morning."
12529,turn the music off.
12530,your smell was everywhere I lived.
12531,"stop it, and give me a towel."
12532,not nearly as crazy as your wife if you tell her I just signed the kid to the state of Texas.
12533,"yes, Elrood's son could cause a lot of trouble."
12534,he joined a group of thieves and nearly broke his mother's heart.
12535,it's your fault she's cheating.
12536,"hey, is there any way I can get you guys to do a story about getting rid of Tree Hill café?"
12537,so you had to prove that Mom was in a coma?
12538,drop your guns.
12539,"death in battle is one thing, but your world of back-alley stabbings and murder disgusts me."
12540,looks like fat is on his way.
12541,it's freezing outside.
12542,but he's sure he wouldn't talk about anything that happened today if he was anywhere else.
12543,too bad his brain is in his biceps.
12544,I'd still be there if he didn't die.
12545,and the pressure from my uterus that makes me walk like I was kicked in the vagina.
12546,do you want Rebecca to see you kill someone?
12547,"normally you'd be dead as a fried chicken, but you pulled this while I'm in a transitional period, and I don't want to kill you."
12548,"Stu, who are you?"
12549,I told you the crime scene.
12550,"sweetie, you've done your pants this year."
12551,I don't want to die like the others.
12552,"Victor, I don't know what you're doing, but it nearly killed you!"
12553,"look, I'm sorry for everything I've said, and I'm sorry for what I've done, but I have to tell you, you're not alone."
12554,"listen, Maxwell... I'm wearing a dress?"
12555,"take out the trash, Dan."
12556,put him in the eye!
12557,"if I can get us a shot at the devil, we have to take it."
12558,"he's in his 40s, his life is almost over."
12559,"which is absurd, isn't it?"
12560,"the guy's a born loser, but you haven't buried him yet."
12561,"in their eyes, you're at best an exotic stranger, at worst a mongrel."
12562,I don't want her to turn into a party girl.
12563,then I'll get rid of you.
12564,So lets cut it.
12565,"""did anyone lose their secret CIA?"""
12566,here's the money I'd spend on you.
12567,you're all that's left of the poor Sheng family?

12569,my breasts!
12570,I said I was there.
12571,can you get this car out of here?
12572,she kisses a lot of white women.
12573,get back.
12574,"for an extra 5 bucks, she'll spit in your face."
12575,the stake must be driven through her.
12576,what's going on?
12577,let's get him out of here.
12578,"you were a fan of my guitar, huh?"
12579,everyone is dead.
12580,where the hell is the rest?
12581,are the rats in the alley going to whip us up a ball gown?
12582,"the woman can't handle a diaper change, but bombing a village?"
12583,Nina seems like the kind of woman who would have killed for the diamonds?
12584,that's what you did.
12585,"I trust you, but this is a mess."
12586,maybe they'll wash your hair.
12587,"no money, no story for the magazine, and on top of everything else I had a huge hotel bill."
12588,"and youre as smart as a big mouthed, small brained, juvenile."
12589,we traded quick death for slow asphyxiation.
12590,"if he catches you, he'll kill you."
12591,convicted of four separate sexual offences involving prostitutes.
12592,what are you doing here?

12599,she looks like a little girl.
12600,I don't know where the rubber band is.
12601,"are you a drug dealer, like your friend Gregory?"
12602,we can't even go into the counting room to watch our money.
12603,try not to kill him.
12604,"and if I may say so, you've found the right decadent, corrupt Western agent as a partner."
12605,"you're breaking the laws of the Soviet Union, and you're looking at 10 years in a Siberian camp."
12606,"even if I were, it wouldn't be just to win this case, it would be to send you to jail."
12607,"this is very bad, what we're doing."

12637,"the lurid descriptions in such texts would be almost comical, were it not for the unhappy fact that even though contemporary sexologists, doctors, writers, etc., have done much to remove the stigma of masturbation, the deep-seated guilts induced by the nonsense in those sexual guides have been only partially"
12638,my breasts are very nice.

12641,"the Premier recognized the unspoken message, the gross disrespect of a man."

12648,I don't have a phobia!

12665,get away from me.
12666,"like, Jersey's De Niro."

12690,"you hear me, you hear me!"

12692,tell me you're crazy about climbing those walls?

13584,"you're gonna work on your abs, but when I need a bypass, you're gonna take your time?"
13585,he made me watch him suck the meat out of my fingers.
13586,it's a hell of an attack.
13587,because they die.
13588,"oh, my God."
13589,what brings you to town other than scaring me at the bookstore?
13590,I don't know anything about the dead coast guard.
13591,"now, I don't want to tell anyone what to think, or how to feel, and I don't want to think about how she died, because that would really make her throw up, but I don't want it to be the summation of her life, because it's not."
13592,"hell, he opened it."
13593,"all right, relax, put the gun down, Tommy."
13594,"""and dance to the music of Esther and the Black Forest Girls."""
13595,get out of here!
13596,"she hasn't said it, but she's not crazy."
13597,"yes, those little punks who took your car door off while you were sitting in it."
13598,she lost her virginity in the same night?
13599,I have a fantasy that I have two capable sons.
13600,"if I can enjoy myself, I can enjoy you too."
13601,get your butt in here!
13602,just get in the car.
13603,I can't have a killer dog.
13604,"what are you doing, Jeff?"
13605,"this one is sicker than most, Vatutin thought wryly."

13607,"""I'm supposed to look like that,"" and I'm going crazy because I don't."
13608,he's got a bomb.
13609,"long time, no see."
13610,"well, then we have to figure out a way to make you better than Barrington, so he's got to take care of you."
13611,slaves... you have arrived at the gladiatorial school of Lentulus Batiatus.
13612,stop being such a baby.
13613,"it's Watson, man."
13614,the only reason I'm here is because 25 years ago I was stuck in a dessert and extracted by another madman.
13615,do you believe God would let me feel mercy for you and his horse?
13616,"it's not, ""let's go to the closet because we're bored with our lives."""
13617,"I'm sick of you, Jonesy!"
13618,that's what this place feels like.
13619,"my parents' murder, everything we've been through, it's all about a list."
13620,just get in the car.
13621,"I'll do what needs to be done, but I'm damned to hell!"
13622,they want you to get rid of her.
13623,Jew like you?
13624,"I just know she's a worthy adversary, and I have to make her mine or I'll destroy her forever."
13625,"good luck, loser."
13626,"at worst, they covered up a rape."
13627,"yeah, but hell."
13628,he shot a guy in a duel and then went back and killed his son because he was afraid he would kill him out of revenge.
13629,"yeah, you beat guys like a girl."
13630,you're one awkward guy.
13631,"I'm tempted to dismiss all of this as a faintly pathetic hobby for noble toffs bored out of their minds by the ingenious tedium, the humiliating inconsequence of Versailles."
13632,"to Florence, where you can take whoever you want, wherever you want, and get away with it."
13633,I don't know why he suddenly stopped talking about it.
13634,even your team is an abomination.
13635,"wake up, you big grizzly bear."
13636,"""get out of here, my people will kill me, I'll call the cops."""

13638,we must return to the place of shame.
13639,now's a good time to do something.
13640,answer the question.
13641,"one day, you'll be in big trouble, and I'll finish you off."
13642,"okay, hell."
13643,"""shoot me, do what you want with me, I won't get up."""
13644,aren't I disgusting enough?
13645,she's a filler.
13646,"okay, but I'll be the one who betrays you after the party."
13647,"no, son, this is over."
13648,I thought you liked girls.
13649,it's fitting that Cain killed his brother with a knife.
13650,you have the best car in the valley.
13651,why don't you come back here and help me?
13652,"hell, this thing makes me smart."
13653,how about a warning?
13654,your father gave up his claim on his financial interests when he murdered Colonel Marsh.
13655,"anyone acts the least aggressive, you do what Kelly did and you throw them out in the snow."
13656,"there was no one in Ludlow - this end of town, anyway - who didn't know Thad was under police protection or police protection, and he didn't have to hear the rumors to know they were already flying."
13657,someone sent me this.
13658,"so my blow is gone, and now these guys are gonna kill me."
13659,sounds like the British were getting ready to sleep with someone.
13660,"I don't know, but it's a hell of a lot."
13661,does it smell or does it blow?
13662,"stop it, help me find it."
13663,"that's how to get all the girls, Jeff."
13664,"in my room, I masturbated and had a pain in my groin."
13665,get in the car.
13666,this is real.
13667,"and they don't see their kids since they were babies, and they don't have their own kids, or they're running around the street with guns and stuff, no one's watching."
13668,I see innocent Giuseppe walking down the streets where Puerto Ricans still listen to Journey.
13669,"""traditional,"" the tailor says."
13670,are you ghosts?
13671,did your dad lose so much when you got married?

13673,just do it for world peace.
13674,"""if you want to ride south, I'll declare you a horse thief and an outlaw."
13675,clean the machine and get out.

13677,stay away from me!
13678,"is he sleeping with us, Bob?"
13679,it wasn't the house!
13680,"if it was damon, someone shot him."
13681,I thought you were crazy.
13682,looks like a war zone.
13683,"you best hope they don't find you because if they do, they'll beat you up."
13684,but my grandmother once referred to a broken beer bottle as a knife.
13685,you promised me you'd make up with your parents.
13686,"you always talk about how much you want to get out of that town and we finally get out of it, and then one little thing happens and you just want to run away?"
13687,shoot him.
13688,"oh, my God."
13689,"Henry, no one cares about what your phone can do."
13690,"well, that's really bad."

13703,"it could be that God stopped the bullets, or he changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys."
13704,"but I need you right now, because I'm in over my head and I feel like I'm losing my mind."
13705,what took you so long?
13706,"his eyes were focused, but his hands trembled."
13707,a fifth of Chivas and a uterus and you could be my mom.
13708,"and no one ever talked about it, either, ""What's going on here?"" or ""What do you think it looks like?"""
13709,"this man has no history, but now seems to have mental problems."
13710,maybe we'll release your tongue.

14084,she paid for it - and she had to clean it up.
14085,and turn the bedroom floor into a Slip 'n Slide.
14086,"hell, you almost made me stay home."
14087,"trust me, after what I've seen, nothing is absurd."
14088,"sorry, guys, the cow scared the life out of me!"

14107,"show of hands, who screwed up an albino chick?"
14108,"because I loved you, David."

14364,"looks like bacon finally got its eggs, huh?"
14365,I've been kissing you since I was 12!
14366,and then go to the Winter Olympics.
14367,"without respect, we're just ordinary people."
14368,they'll tear you apart.
14369,that would have worked for me.
14370,"in a week, your skin will dry out, and you'll be able to smell."
14371,he's completely crazy!
14372,you want me to bite?
14373,"okay, hit me."
14374,"that means her plan was to get you drunk, wait till you pass out and rob you blind."
14375,what's going on?
14376,some guy ripped up his forms.

14389,"no, ""gay."""
14390,"go on leave, talk to your union rep, get reinstated, then come back and kick as much as you can."

14397,how did you find out where I am?

14418,that makes sense.
14419,"first of all, you make me sick."
14420,what's going on with him?
14421,"but look at them, they seem unhappy to you?"

14443,he's not as crazy as he looks.
14444,I think I'm gonna go small tonight.
14445,"she has every reason to hate us, and she's unstable."
14446,Kaori will go back to the priest.

14745,I didn't want my brother to mess up.
14746,you forgot the garbage can.
14747,"""I'm not crazy."
14748,here's his mess.
14749,"I did some things, and I guess I got in Ari's way a little bit."
14750,maybe I'll be lucky and they'll take him.
14751,you're kidding me?
14752,"relationships, husbands, wives, parents."
14753,I just worked out why all this happened.
14754,"telling people what they already know, trying to say it in a way that gives them permission to make a decision they should have made."
14755,that moralizing old fart!
14756,I'll throw you out of the ship.
14757,mom was crazy.
14758,Hatch--he's dead!
14759,I wouldn't follow that guy anywhere.
14760,"none of them were worth anything as detectives, as investigators."
14761,"what's wrong with you, Jackie?"
14762,"here's to the old hole, here's to me, and here's to my new life."
14763,you street urchin...
14764,"Saddam used chemical weapons against the Kurds, and he killed thousands."
14765,I keep telling her how good she was.
14766,when was the last time you slept together?
14767,but the boy may die.
14768,"Jesus, Joe."
14769,when did you say you had a bite?
14770,there were three hideous monsters... sisters... they were called Gorgons.
14771,"I'm just saying, you look like a regular guinea pig."
14772,"""for the man of the hour, you look like a second-class roadkill."""
14773,"no, Joosep was just telling me how to shoot."
14774,"no, you have to kill a live cow."
14775,"oh, my God."
14776,you're Jackson's spy!
14777,"Klaus is so obsessed with the wolves, and Elijah is so wrapped up in his family's old stuff that he can't see it."
14778,a bad girl.
14779,spit it out.
14780,"hey, if a bunch of holy people want to kill each other, I'm happy."
14781,put him down!
14782,"get up, you have my stuff!"
14783,lmao i saw that
14784,well then do it
14785,this guy hurt you.
14786,"Bobby, what are you doing?"
14787,I'll take you back to Val...
14788,"you've walked so long behind me, it's inevitable that one day you'll stab me in the back."
14789,that would be funny if it wasn't so scary.
14790,but leave Ovidius with empty hands.
14791,it would be funny if they didn't offer so much money.
14792,"""we have to get out of here."""
14793,"so here he is, the bad guy who's been in the city."
14794,should we beat him up?
14795,"and to celebrate our weekly debauchery, I offered our lovely sales assistant, Danielle Harrison, $10,000 to shave her head!"
14796,"if Max got within five feet of Tony, he'd beat him up with his little cane."
14797,"there's a rope around my neck, and they only hang you once."
14798,"baby, you don't deserve to be living the way you are."
14799,I'm going to get drunk.
14800,"just like when I covered for you when you were dealing drugs, and then you dumped me as a thank you?"
14801,so I took the shotgun out of the wall and fired two warning shots into his head.
14802,you're not ugly like me.
14803,"Nani Vitali, a dangerous criminal, killed two people You know what he's known?"

14809,"yes, and I slept with my wife after lunch."
14810,"it's just a day in April when people play pranks on each other, and then they yell, ""April Fools!"""
14811,"so, Eggs describes a list of symptoms and you repeat them to a doctor, which is particularly silly because this is a free clinic."

14813,because you look like a lemon.
14814,stay away from me!
14815,she's worse than you.
14816,"God, how do you hate us white people after all we've done to you?"
14817,you scared the hell out of us.
14818,"dude, this place is sick!"
14819,I can see in his eyes.
14820,full of good vibes and love from a black Cuban witch in Miami.
14821,but I was just a girl with a bad family.
14822,"hey, I know you're only ten, but listen up."
14823,"goodbye, simpleton."
14824,tell Batten I shot his dog.
14825,"if he's greedy, he'll need one."
14826,bloody hell.
14827,I don't like him.

14829,"and while he slept, I logged into Hoytsman's computer and flooded it with Thai pornography."

14835,Cha Tae Shik... call an ambulance.
14836,the name suits our purposes far more than a pile of rubble.
14837,you're like one of those sniffer dogs.
14838,other doctors will think you're crazy.
14839,it's called a spear.
14840,they would have loved to have you dead for they thought they could blame the government.
14841,what does my mother know about this?
14842,I don't mind skinny girls.
14843,"well, it was your fault."
14844,"if you don't get out of here so I can spend some time with my man, next time I'll show you my dog."
14845,there's no Viet Con in R Point!
14846,I thought you all thought alike!
14847,"he doesn't care about you, do you?"
14848,men love it when a woman is not afraid to show her love for sex.
14849,"Tanya, we can't get closer to you, because Patty is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder after the kidnapping."

14853,you said the past was nothing but black magnetism.
14854,"black, no... Yeah."
14855,"well, thank you for being so bad."

14882,don 't get how comments like that even get upvoted here.

15072,why are you dressed like a cop?
15073,"you didn't just want me to shoot your bed, pillows, sheets, did you?"
15074,"every other weekend, just for the nanny?"
15075,"you know, and let's talk about business first."
15076,"born, I believe, in Nagasaki, it really seems absurd."
15077,It went over like a sandwich.
